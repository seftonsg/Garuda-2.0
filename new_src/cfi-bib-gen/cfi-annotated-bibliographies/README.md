# Annotated Bibliographies

Article Titles are ones that were directly added to the repo. Links are for ones not in the repo.

The annotations will be added over time. Here are the first few papers for now.

1) [Hardware-Assisted Fine-Grained Control-Flow Integrity: Towards Efficient Protection of Embedded Systems Against Software Exploitation, 2014](https://github.com/gstew5/Hardware/blob/master/cfi-generation/cfi-annotated-bibliographies/Hardware-Assisted%20Fine-Grained%20Control-Flow%20Integrity.pdf)

Implementing fine-grained CFI protection by adding new instructions to hardware for calls and returns. Hardware would have a
memory device to keep track of function labels in use. Counters used to detect ROP attacks with Indirect jumps. Indirect jump
protection could be done by limiting them to active functions (false positives possible?). 

2) [Control-Flow Integrity
